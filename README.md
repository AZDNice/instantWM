instantWM is a custom window manager for instantOS. 

## Installation
It is preinstalled on instantOS  
You can manually install the git build by cloning the repo and then running build.sh

```
git clone https://github.com/instantOS/instantWM.git
cd instantWM
./build.sh
```

It can be used outside of instantOS but it is recommended to install instantutils and instantassist alongside it. 

## Features

Documentation for instantWM can be found in the general documentation for instantOS and the instructional screencasts. 

## is this dwm?

instantWM initially started out as a dwm fork. It contains over 2000 lines of code not found in dwm. Given that dwm only has around 3000 lines of code, 
it is save to say that it is now quite its own thing. It is by now incompatible with most dwm patches and doesn't share its keybindings, appearance and philosophy. 
It for instance doesn't sacrifice features for storage. For a program that is 40kb in size, it should be okay to worry about speed and features more than finding 
hacks to decrease lines of code. Also it is meant to be used as-is. It is a finished product that you download and use.
